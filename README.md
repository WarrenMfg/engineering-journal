## How to Use

Static `.html` files exist for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the MERN stack: MongoDB, Express, React, and Node. Customize as you see fit.

But a generic `topic.html` file exists as a template for custom topics, with full CRUD capabilities:

![Add topic](gifs/add-topic.gif)
![Edit topic name](gifs/edit-topic-name.gif)

As well as full CRUD capabilities on each resource on all topics:
